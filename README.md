# AI Grade Recognition  
**Emotional Intent Analysis from Teacher Reviews**

AI Grade Recognition is a portfolio-focused **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that analyzes written student reviews to identify underlying **sentiment and emotional intent** toward teachers. Implemented as a **Jupyter Notebook** using Python, the project demonstrates applied machine learning, transformer-based models, and data-driven insight generation.

The goal is to extract meaningful patterns from unstructured educational feedback and translate them into actionable analytics about teaching quality and student perception.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This application processes natural language reviews and classifies them by emotional intent using a **zero-shot learning approach**. Rather than relying on labeled training data, it leverages state-of-the-art transformer models to infer sentiment and emotion directly from text.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Sentiment & Emotion Classification**  
  Automatically identifies emotional intent in student-written teacher reviews.

- **Advanced NLP Processing**  
  Uses transformer-based language models for high-quality semantic understanding.

- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**  
  Transparent, step-by-step analysis suitable for experimentation, learning, and demonstration.

## 📊 Data & Models

### Dataset
- Sourced from **RateMyProfessors.com** teacher reviews  
- Real-world, unstructured educational feedback data  

### Models Used
- `facebook/bart-large-mnli`
- `valhalla/distilbart-mnli-12-1`

Both models are applied using a **zero-shot classification strategy**, allowing flexible sentiment and emotion labeling without task-specific training.
